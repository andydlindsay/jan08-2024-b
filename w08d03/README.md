# W08D03 - Unit & Integration Testing

### To Do
- [x] Tools for testing React
- [x] Coverage Reports
- [x] Add Features/Tests to our App
- [x] `debug()` and `prettyDOM()`
- [x] Mocking AJAX Requests and Functions

### Types of Testing
* static - syntax checking while you type
* manual - coder running the code (expensive)
* unit - testing the smallest pieces of our code (functions)
* integration - test pieces of your app working together
* end-to-end - test your app like your user
* a/b - you give your users two different interfaces

### Tests
1. Make the computer choose something other than Moai (most of the time)



### Layers of Testing React
* Jest - command line test runner
* Testing Library - generic DOM testing library
* React Testing Library - for rendering React components
* Jest-DOM - extra matchers for testing things like ids, classes
